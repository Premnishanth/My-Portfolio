								<p>With a profound dedication to data analytics and a relentless pursuit of excellence in the field, I bring a wealth of expertise and experience to the realm of business insights. Holding a Master of Science in Business Insights and Analytics from Humber College, Toronto, and a Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical and Electronics from Anna University, I have cultivated a robust foundation encompassing both technical acumen and analytical prowess.</p>
								<p>My professional journey commenced with a transformative role as a Business Analyst at Temenos India Pvt Ltd in Chennai, India, spanning from November 2017 to December 2021. Here, I assumed leadership responsibilities, guiding and nurturing a team of data analytics and microservices professionals. Through this experience, I emphasized the value of continual learning and collaborative synergy, underscoring the significance of teamwork within the realm of data-driven decision-making.</p>
								<p>Within Temenos, my responsibilities revolved around crafting sophisticated SQL queries within relational databases. These queries served as catalysts for extracting invaluable insights from intricate datasets, thereby informing strategic initiatives and refining business paradigms. Leveraging Power BI, I conducted comprehensive analyses of patient foot health data, identifying pivotal trends essential for enhancing insole design methodologies and optimizing patient care strategies.</p>
								<p>Transitioning into the role of a Data Analyst at Equo Services Inc. in Toronto, Ontario, starting from July 2023, I spearheaded transformative endeavors in data analysis and reporting. By seamlessly integrating and deploying tools such as Google Analytics GA4, Google Table Manager, Google Data Studio, and Power BI, I facilitated enhanced decision-making processes and operational efficiency improvements. Collaborating closely with internal stakeholders, I garnered profound insights into the organization's evolving business landscape and strategic imperatives.</p>
								<p>A highlight of my tenure at Equo Services Inc. was the implementation of robust data governance frameworks and ETL practices. This endeavor ensured the integrity, coherence, and reliability of user engagement reporting within the digital marketing domain, thereby fortifying the organization's operational backbone. Additionally, I excelled in generating actionable reports and harnessing data-driven analytics to delineate key performance indicators and operational metrics.</p>
								<p>Driven by an unwavering commitment to excellence and a passion for harnessing the power of data, I stand poised to deliver profound value and insights to any organization's analytical endeavors.</p>
